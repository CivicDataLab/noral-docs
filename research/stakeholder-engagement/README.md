# Stakeholder Engagement

### Background

One of the key objectives of the initial phase involves actively interacting and engaging stakeholders in various research activities. Identifying their pain areas, challenges, aspirations, behaviours, patterns which can lead the research to define the direction of the project in larger scope. The main purpose of stakeholder research for this project was to explore the unknown and unlock new possibilities to address the realities faced by them.

There were four bukcets of primary stakeholders identified for this project:

* Attainment Advisors
* Educational Psychologists
* School Leaders
* Quality Improvement Managers / Quality Improvement Officers / Education Support Officers

### Framework

The following approach was undertaken better understand the stakeholders:

* **Survey **: As a first step of the stakeholder research a survey was conducted to better understand the current landscape, primary users, their aspirations and challenges faced along the way.

{% endcontent-ref %}

* **Workshop **: Following the initial survey, a workshop was conducted with the key stakeholders to get inputs on the data and tools most frequently used by the stakeholders, the challenges faced by them while engaging with the information and systems in the current form, and their inputs on certain possible features for a new solution.

* **Interviews** : Conducted individual interviews with primary and secondary stakeholders to understand their role in the ecosystem, what does a working day look like for them, what kind of data sets does the stakeholder interact with, the challenges faced and dreams / aspiration with respect to data and ecosystem.

All the information generated from various primary and secondary stakeholder touchpoints was consildated to create Personas and Jounreys to envision the ideal solution for their needs.
