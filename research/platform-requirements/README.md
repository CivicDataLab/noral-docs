# Platform Requirements

### Background

Through **Stakeholder Engagement** and **Existing Tools Review** , we were able to clearly understand the following details about the data and digital tools ecosystem of the Northern Alliance region of Scotland.

* Experience of key staeholders in the existing ecosystem of data and tools, the challenges faced by them while engaging with the information and systems in the current form.

{% endcontent-ref %}

* Background, features and limitations of existing tools used by the key stakholders, a comprehenvie evaluation of their usability and applicability.

{% endcontent-ref %}

* Feedback of key stakeholders on certain possible features for a new solution, that solves their key challenges to act in the ecosystem.

### Framework

Through all these interactions with the key stakeholders, we were able to collect a lot of important information about their aspirations from a new system. The same were used to explore how features could be developed, the toolkit finalised to execute these features and the model to host all the possible data on the platform.
