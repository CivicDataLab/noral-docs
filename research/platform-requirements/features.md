# Features

During the stakeholder workshop, the stakeholders were asked to share their inputs on certain suggested features and what they would like to see as the solutions. The features were, Information Mapping, Comparative Analysis, Data Collection, Open Access, Data Stories and Capacity Building.

### Toolkit

Based on the [feeback](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/tree/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/feature-feedback) recieved from the stakeholder for each of the individual features, a research was conducted to decide the possible toolkit which will be used to build the final solution. Another important aspect that was taken into consideration is that all the tools selected are Free and Open Source Softwares.

> We have also hosted demo versions of some of these tools for the stakeholders to experience.

### Way Forward

Using the requirements set for the features by the key stakeholders and the tools seclected to achieve the same, a platform architecture was devised for the new proposed solution.
