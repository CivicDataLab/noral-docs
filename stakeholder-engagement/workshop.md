# Workshop

Following the initial [Stakeholder Survey](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/01-stakeholder-survey), a workshop was conducted with the key stakeholders to get inputs on the following fronts:

* The data tools and resources most frequently used by Stakeholders and their experiences with the same.
* The challenges faced by them while engaging with the information and systems in the current form.
* Their inputs on certain possible features for a new solution and how would like to to engage with the same.

The workshop objectives and format can be seen [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/02-01-workshop.md) , and the template for the workshop MURAL boards can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/02-02-template.pdf).

### Summary

#### Tool Feedback

All the stakeholders were asked to share the most frequently used tools and review them on the following criteria:

* Things they liked about the tool / platform.
* Things they didn't like about the tool / platform.
* Things they would like to improve about the tool / platform.

All the findings from the section of the workshop was consolidated along with an in-depth design audit of the most frequently mentioned platforms.

#### Feature Feedback

The other part of the workshop focused on better understanding the challenges the users are facing and how would they like to solve for the same. The users were asked to share inputs certain suggested features and the what they would like to see as the solutions.

The features discussed were as follows:

* [Information Mapping](workshop.md#background) : Layering numerous sources of information in an area around education (child, teacher, parents, etc.) to services available (healthcare, financing, justice, etc.) for better tracking the factors affecting the education of a child.
* [Comparative Analysis](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/feature-feedback/002-comparative-analysis.md) : Ability to compare areas, schools, authorities on availability of resources (financing, facilities, etc.) and outcomes of the education system (attainment. etc.)
* [Data Collection](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/feature-feedback/003-data-collection.md) : Mechanism to collect and store data from numerous on-ground collection methodologies in a central location linked to various other information about the area.
* [Open Access](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/feature-feedback/004-open-access.md) : Creating an open data platform where all public interest information is available to key stakeholders and citizens to better engage with their community.
* [Data Stories](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/feature-feedback/005-data-stories.md) : Ability to showcase specific analyses, reports, stories, etc. for various use cases with the methodology and the data made accesible for further research.
* [Capacity Building](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/feature-feedback/006-capacity-building.md) : Enabling key stakeholders and community at large to better adopt / use the tool and technologies, through various resources embedded into the platform.

The feedback for each individual feature has been consolidated [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/tree/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/feature-feedback). You can also go through the raw workshop outputs bucket by themes [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-user-research/blob/main/research/02-stakeholder-workshop/02-03-feature-feedback.pdf\_). This feedback was used to explore the possible tools and technologies that can be used to build the final solution.

### Methodology

* The workshop was conducted using collaboration tool, [MURAL](https://www.mural.co).
* The stakeholders were divided in groups of 3-5 with varying roles and experiences.
* Each group was moderated by a project team member to conduct the workshop and take notes.
