The challenge

* Setting the Geographical context
* Setting the Education context
* Identifying the key challenges

Here are the typical kinds of information found in most abstracts:

1. the **context** or background information for your research; the **general topic** under study; the **specific topic** of your research
2. the **central questions** or statement of the **problem** your research addresses
3. **whatâ€™s already known** about this question, what **previous research** has done or shown
4. the main **reason(s)**, the exigency, the **rationale**, the **goals** for your researchâ€”Why is it important to address these questions? Are you, for example, examining a new topic? Why is that topic worth examining? Are you filling a gap in previous research? Applying new methods to take a fresh look at existing ideas or data? Resolving a dispute within the literature in your field? . . .
5. your research and/or analytical **methods**
6. your main **findings**, **results**, or **arguments**
7. the **significance** or **implications** of your findings or arguments.

Your abstract should be intelligible on its own, without a readerâ€™s having to read your entire paper. And in an abstract, you usually do _not_ cite referencesâ€”most of your abstract will describe what _you_ have studied in your research and what _you_ have found and what _you_ argue in your paper. In the body of your paper, you will cite the specific literature that informs your research.
