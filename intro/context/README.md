# ðŸ§Š Context

The places where children and young people grow up in are extremely diverse and can greatly influence the outcomes of children and families across Scotland. Children and families can be negatively affected by a broad range of circumstances, including poverty and the associated impacts of it. Nonetheless, each place has their own unique context to consider when holistically assessing the relationship between child poverty and attainment and determining the actions required to mitigate the effects. Yet, the extent to which we can understand the impact of these place-based characteristics can be limited by the availability and density of data and information at hand.&#x20;

### **Why Does itâ€¯ Matter?**â€¯&#x20;

Education and children services are in a unique position where they can work collaboratively across sectors to reduce structural inequalities and collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders to get it right for every child. This can be facilitated by having a deeper understanding of the mechanisms in which educational attainment can be negatively affected by poverty and subsequently support professionals to design bespoke interventions suitable to their own unique context and achieve excellence and equity of educational outcomes for children and young people.

* Identifying the key challenges

Here are the typical kinds of information found in most abstracts:

1. the **context** or background information for your research; the **general topic** under study; the **specific topic** of your research
2. the **central questions** or statement of the **problem** your research addresses
3. **whatâ€™s already known** about this question, what **previous research** has done or shown
4. the main **reason(s)**, the exigency, the **rationale**, the **goals** for your researchâ€”Why is it important to address these questions? Are you, for example, examining a new topic? Why is that topic worth examining? Are you filling a gap in previous research? Applying new methods to take a fresh look at existing ideas or data? Resolving a dispute within the literature in your field? . . .
5. your research and/or analytical **methods**
6. your main **findings**, **results**, or **arguments**
7. the **significance** or **implications** of your findings or arguments.

Your abstract should be intelligible on its own, without a readerâ€™s having to read your entire paper. And in an abstract, you usually do _not_ cite referencesâ€”most of your abstract will describe what _you_ have studied in your research and what _you_ have found and what _you_ argue in your paper. In the body of your paper, you will cite the specific literature that informs your research.
