To achieve that it is required to raise attainment and reduce educational inequity for all of Scotland’s children and young people. The Scottish education system works well for most children and young people, who make good progress in their learning. However, there is still a gap between the least and most deprived areas in terms of attainment and socioeconomic status.

The data and the tools are driven by data play a key role to help the Scottish education system identify, understand, and achieve this larger goal of reducing the attainment and socioeconomics gap. These available tools are used by major stakeholders and assist them to create a better school improvement framework and also support them to give the contextual analysis.
