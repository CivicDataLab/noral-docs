# Design Audit

### Background

Design consistency has the power to influence the experience of users of any digital product. An inconsistently designed product can directly affect user trust and likability negatively. Design Audit for such inconsistent products comes into play here. It is considered as a preventive checkup of a digital product, performed by design experts to identify the deficiencies and the ideal experience.

In a design audit, the design experts thoroughly examine all elements of a digital product based on their business objectives, metrics, and usability standards. They then list down the areas of improvement and recommend solutions to improve the overall experience.

### Objectives

The core objective of conducting a design audit is to evaluate the interactions between a digital product and its users. These interactions come in a wide range and majorly influence the user experience or a product.

It is very natural for business owners, managers, founders, designers and developers to get too close to their product and avoid noticing the essential flaws in those interactions. Here Design Audits provide an unbiased and objective view of a productâ€™s strengths and weaknesses and provide actionable design direction.

### Tools Reviewed

Design audits played a significant role in the process of solving a larger problem focusing on improving education and reducing the poverty-related attainment gap in Scotland. These design audits gave us various insights into the users' expectations, their ways of interaction with tools, and in evaluating these tools as per general design standards. As a part of design audit exercise 23 performed the evaluation for all five tools mentioned below:

1. [Insight](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/blob/main/design-audit/tools/001-Insight.md)
2. [SIMD](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/blob/main/design-audit/tools/002-SIMD.md)
3. [BGE Tool Kit](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/blob/main/design-audit/tools/003-BGE-Toolkit.md)
4. [NIF Interactive Evidence Report](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/blob/main/design-audit/tools/004-NIF-Interactive-Evidence-Report.md)

### Methodology

Our methodology for performing a design audit exercise involves analyzing all the design elements used across a digital platform/tool in order to ensure the usability measures branding is consistent across the channel. Detailed documentation of the Design Audit Methodology can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Data-for-Children-Collaborative/noral-design-research/blob/main/design-audit/\_methodology.md).
