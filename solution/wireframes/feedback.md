# Feedback

Stakeholder feedback is an integral part of our research process. Good designs get buy-in and feedback from stakeholders throughout the design’s evolution. This means getting feedback early with the  concepts, then later on the execution of that idea, and then finally on the nitty-gritty details before handoff.

### Step 1 : User Personas and Journeys

Please go through the user personas generated for the stakeholder bucket that aligns with your current role the most.

* Brainstorm within the group on the information provided in the persona
* Verify the information mentioned in the persona related to your work
* Provide feedback on any additions or changes required to the persona

#### Total Time : `20 mins`

#### How will we use this information?

Stakeholder verification on the personas will confirm whether we have interpreted the needs and aspirations of each stakeholder in the right way to build the final solution.

#### Feedback Required

Kindly elaborate your views on the questions stated below.

1. Are all the existing data sets mapped correctly for your individual role?
2. Kindly confirm whether all the frustrations, motivations and aspirations are correctly mapped?
3. Is the user journey feasible and viable for the role that you play?
4. Is there anything else you’d like to share?

### Step 2 : Wireframe Run Through

The wider objective within this initial phase was to work with stakeholders to identify the shared knowledge gap across local authorities, identify the most appropriate indicators and map the suitable data sources that can be used at the school catchment aggregation. With this goal in mind we tried addressing the aspirations and frustrations of each stakeholder while developing the wireframes. Each stakeholder has a dedicated space planned on the platform with functions that are suitable and inlined with their requirements and needs.&#x20;

Most frequently occurring themes for the new solution envisioned.

The above word cloud caters to the needs and aspirations of each stakeholder. Currently we are addressing the landing page for each stakeholder and common pages which are required by each stakeholder to get all the necessary information from the envisioned platform.

#### Total Time : `40 mins`

#### How will we use this information?

Qualitative feedback received from the stakeholders will help the designers realign their goals and design decisions as per your needs. It will ensure that the user journey for the solution is further aligned to the user goals of your role.

#### How to navigate the wireframes?

* Kindly click on the stakeholder bucket you identify with the most in your role.&#x20;
* Follow the step by step walkthrough of each page to understand the details.
* Make a note of your views and suggestions while exploring the wireframes

#### What is the type of feedback we are looking for?

Constructive feedback ensures both designer and stakeholders to continue to move forward through the design process and effectively solve the problems at hand. Below are a few of the main talking points to keep in mind when reviewing a wireframe.

**Aspirations** - Is the information on the page aligning with the aspiration / expectation you had in your mind? Is there something on this page that you would like to add or remove?

**Page Purpose** - Is the primary purpose of the page unequivocal and clear?

**Navigation** - How is your experience with the navigation through the page presented? Is it smooth or confusing? Are there too many steps to any certain actions? Please feel free to put down your thoughts.

**Content** - Does the content make sense to you and is grouped correctly with surrounding information? Would you like to add any further information to make the page more explanatory?

**Layout** - Are you comfortable with the information flow on the page, with respect to spacing, readability and actionability of the information?

Is there anything else you’d like to share?
