# üìë Wireframes

Keeping in mind all the insights gained from the several stakeholder engagements we have also generated preliminary wireframes with the help of user flows which showcases the first cut trailer of how the platform will shape for each user.&#x20;

### What are wireframes?

A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you, or your stakeholders to  think, communicate and review  about the structure of the platform you're building.

### Why are we showcasing wireframes?

* **Wireframes make it clear that this is not the final design** : No one could mistake a wireframe for the final look and feel of your application. Low-fidelity and few colors force you to focus on structure over details. There will be lots of time for visual design once the structure is finalized.
* **Wireframes convey that ‚Äúthis is all up for discussion‚Äù** : The rough feel encourages discussion. We call it a look no one is afraid to criticize. Wireframes are really quick to make, so don't be shy with giving feedback! Each screen probably only took a few minutes to make; don't worry, their author won't mind doing them over from scratch. What matters the most at this point is the final ease of use, so going through a few iterations is normal and expected.
* **Wireframes make it clear that no code has been written yet** : If a stakeholder received some screens that looked like screenshots of the final app, instead of a wireframe, they might assume that all the code behind those screenshots had already been written. This is most often not the case. Wireframes don't have this danger.
